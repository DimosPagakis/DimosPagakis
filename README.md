### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dimosthenis Pagakis, but do not let it intimidate you, you can call me Dimos. I am a full-stack web & mobile developer from Greece currently working remotely at [CWA](https://www.cwa.gr/). Always open to new projects and challenges, I spend my days writing or reviewing code, managing projects, improving my skills or playing basketball #Go_Bucks.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
Right now I'm managing an earthquake response project funded by Partnership Agreement 2014-2020 and also developing its API using Laravel & Mongo. At the same time, I'm the front-end developer at an extremely interesting startup project for peer-to-peer yacht renting. I'm creating a universal SPA with Nuxt & Vue and a couple of hybrid mobile applications with Ionic Angular.

### ðŸ“šðŸ’»ðŸŽ’ Pet projects
Along with 2 dear friends and colleagues, [Dimitris](https://github.com/Dimitris-Provatas) & [Haris](https://github.com/hariskor), we have created a pet project about university students' resource management. We developed an Express & GraphQL API using Mongo and a web application with React. All development was done using TDD and we could not be more thrilled. The project has been under a minor stalemate for the time being due to increased work load but we are sure we will meet again.

You can review the code base here. [API](https://github.com/BenSheep/API) & [Web App](https://github.com/BenSheep/Client)

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
I'm currently on the lookout for new frameworks and technologies to learn and also taking an online course at Coursera about [Understanding User Needs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-user-needs).

 ### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
 Anything that piques my interest really. As long as I like the project and I do have time to put in quality work I'm always up to the task.

### âš¡ Fun facts about me
I never though of picking up coding until I was 19 years old but I have been in love ever since.

I graduated from the Ionian University with a degree on the science of Information and Informatics with a grade of 8.17.
