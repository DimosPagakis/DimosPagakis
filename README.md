### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dimosthenis Pagakis, but do not let it intimidate you, you can call me Dimos. I am a full-stack web & mobile developer from Greece that designs UI/UX from time to time. Always open to new projects and challenges, I spend my days writing or reviewing code, improving my technical skills, building a clientele or playing basketball #Go_Bucks (Summer 2021 update: NBA CHAMPS BABY).

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
Creating the corporate metaverse and so much more by joining powers with [INVRTUAL](https://invrtual.de/). Putting my Vue and Laravel skills to work I maintain and improve the current product, implement and optimize payment flows with Stripe, migrating our session/call logic to Janus WebRTC and much more.

### ðŸ“šðŸ’»ðŸŽ’ Pet projects
Alongside some friends ([Dimitris](https://github.com/Dimitris-Provatas) & [Haris](https://github.com/hariskor)) we created an online magazine website. The magazine is called [BANAL](https://banalmagazine.gr). We created a Laravel API to handle basic CRUD functionality, pdf to image transformation, queued jobs and integrated with the [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) API. For the front-end, we created a universal (SSR) application using Vue.js and the Nuxt framework. We created multiple clean, lean and reusable components, both for the front facing app but also the admin, implemented a pageflip view of the issues of the magazine and integrated with Google Analytics. We also took care of the UI design using Figma. We implemented everything with usability, minimalism and SEO in mind. 2 years, a number of issues and quite many subscribers later we keep on building upon the foundation we first released and are always trying to find ways to improve.

_(Disclaimer: The magazine is in greek and all about society, arts, poetry and many more subjects)_

Dimitris, Haris and I have also created a pet project about university students' resource management. We developed an Express & GraphQL API using Mongo and a web application with React. All development was done using TDD and we could not be more thrilled. The project has been under a stalemate.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
I'm currently on the lookout for new frameworks and technologies to learn. I also graduated from a [Product Management](https://www.udacity.com/course/product-manager-nanodegree--nd036) nanodegree program provided by Udacity. Product Management is my future dream job and I'm actively gathering as much knowledge to be used when the opportuinity is presented.

 ### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
 Anything that piques my interest really. As long as I like the project and I do have time to put quality work in, I'm always up to the task.
 
 _2023 Update: I'm currently overwhelmed with work and not actively open to collaboration for the time being_
 
### âš¡ Fun facts about me
I never though of picking up coding until I was 19 years old but I have been in love ever since.

I graduated from the Ionian University of Informatics with a degree on the science of Information and Informatics with a 8.17 GPA.

I beat obesity and was able to drop a total of 60kg.

I play basketball, visit the gym regularly and am always thinking of fun apps to create.
