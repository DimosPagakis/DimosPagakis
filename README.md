### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dimosthenis Pagakis, but do not let it intimidate you, you can call me Dimos. I am a full-stack web & mobile developer from Greece. Always open to new projects and challenges, I spend my days writing or reviewing code, managing projects, improving my skills or playing basketball #Go_Bucks.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
**Will start serving my mandatory army duties March 2021**

Right now I'm working alongside some friends ([Dimitris](https://github.com/Dimitris-Provatas) & [Haris](https://github.com/hariskor)) in creating and maintaining an online magazine website. The magazine is called [BANAL](https://banalmagazine.gr). We created a Laravel API to handle basic CRUD functionality, pdf to image transformation, queued jobs and integrated with the [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) API. For the front-end, we created a universal (SSR) application using Vue.js and the Nuxt framework. We created multiple clean, lean and reusable components, both for the front facing app but also the admin, implemented a pageflip view of the issues of the magazine and integrated with Google Analytics. We also took care of the UI design using Figma. We implemented everything with usability, minimalism and SEO in mind. Right now we have released our first issue and are currently under Alpha.

_(Disclaimer: The magazine is in greek and none of the people on the dev team are authors. The magazine is about society, arts, poetry and many more subjects)_

### ðŸ“šðŸ’»ðŸŽ’ Pet projects
Dimitris, Haris and I have also created a pet project about university students' resource management. We developed an Express & GraphQL API using Mongo and a web application with React. All development was done using TDD and we could not be more thrilled. The project has been under a minor stalemate for the time being due to increased work load but we are sure we will meet again.

You can review the code base here. [API](https://github.com/BenSheep/API) & [Web App](https://github.com/BenSheep/Client)

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
I'm currently on the lookout for new frameworks and technologies to learn and also taking an online nanodegree program at Udacity about [Product Management](https://www.udacity.com/course/product-manager-nanodegree--nd036)

 ### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
 Anything that piques my interest really. As long as I like the project and I do have time to put quality work in, I'm always up to the task.

### âš¡ Fun facts about me
I never though of picking up coding until I was 19 years old but I have been in love ever since.

I graduated from the Ionian University with a degree on the science of Information and Informatics with a 8.17 GPA.

I beat obesity and was able to drop a total of 50kg.

I play basketball, visit the gym regularly and am always thinking of fun apps to create.
